## 👨‍💻 About Me
I started my professional journey in operational environments, where I learned how to organize information, solve problems, and improve processes.  
Over time, I realized that behind every good decision there is one key element: **data**.

In the last **2 years**, I’ve been transitioning into Data Analytics, developing skills through hands-on projects using **Python, SQL, Power BI**, and data visualization to create clear insights and support decision-making.

I enjoy transforming messy datasets into **clean reports and dashboards** that generate real business value — especially in **operations and business analytics**.
